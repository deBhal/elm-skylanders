Skylanders.elm
==============

This is a little toy to explore the elements and classes of the Skylanders Imaginators Senseis I built for my son to play, and to check out elm.

You can run it over your locally with
	`elm-live --host=0.0.0.0 skylanders.elm`

There are a still a number of things about the UI and the implementation that bug me, but it was a great learning experience and has got my sons thumbs up, so I'm going to draw a line here and call it done.

The Licencing on the Air, Earth, Fire and Water Symbols is a little unclear, as they're credited to Deviant Art user [Xelku9](http://xelku9.deviantart.com/), with a reference to http://xelku9.deviantart.com/art/Skylanders-Elemental-gems-490034308 but it looks like all the symbols were uploaded by wikia user [PrincessNightMoon](http://skylanders.wikia.com/wiki/User:Princess_Nightmoon) on September 26 2016, derived from images from the official website (http://skylanders.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Princess_Nightmoon?offset=20161102141128&limit=500&target=Princess+Nightmoon)

The wikia is using these images under [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States), and I believe I'm also using them under [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States) in the same sort of way as the wikia is<sup title="Specifically, I think this work is transformative and will not reduce the potential market for any of the works">[1]</sup>. I am, however, entirely happy to take down any of the images at the copyright holders request.
